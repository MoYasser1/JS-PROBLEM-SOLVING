// In the provided code, there are several concepts being used in the JavaScript language to work with arrays of numbers.

// First, we have the array `numbers` that contains a set of numbers. In this example, the numbers are `[10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 30, 50, 50]`. It appears that the numbers are repeated in the array.

// Then, a new concept in JavaScript called a "Set" is utilized to remove duplicate elements from the array. Here, we use the expression `new Set(numbers)` to create a new set that contains only the unique elements from the array. In this case, the set will contain the numbers `[10, 20, 30, 50]`.

// Finally, the spread syntax `...` is used to convert the set into a new array. The unique elements are stored in the `uniqueNumbers` array.

// At the end of the code, `console.log(uniqueNumbers)` is used to print the `uniqueNumbers` array to the console in the browser or runtime environment. The unique numbers `[10, 20, 30, 50]` will be displayed in the console.
